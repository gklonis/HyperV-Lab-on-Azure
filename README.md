# Azure Hyper-V Lab

Hey everyone ðŸ‘‹

This Template will automate the deployment of an Azure IaaS VM running Windows Server 2022 OS, having Hyper-V Role enabled. By this, you will be able to experiment with Hyper-V, learn, build a proof of concept or non-production environments or even use it as staging environment for creating custom images that will be used on public Azure.

The Template consists of the following resources:

+ A Virtual Network(VNet) with 1 Subnet
+ A Standard SKU Static Public IP
+ A Network Security Group (NSG) configured to allow Remote Desktop Connections
+ A Virtual Machine that is capable of Nested Virtualization - 
+ Two Premium SSD Disks - One for Operating System(127GB) and One for Storing Virtual Machines(512GB)

Server Roles:

+ Hyper-V
+ DHCP Server
+ RSAT Tools
+ Containers

Additional Software Included with the VM:

+ Azure Az PowerShell module
+ Azure CLI
+ Azure Storage Explorer
+ AzCopy Utility
+ PowerShell Core
+ Windows Admin Center
+ 7-Zip
+ Chocolatey Package Manager
